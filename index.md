## Want to Learn Python?

Learn Python is a D-Lab working group on the UC Berkeley campus. We hold weekly meetings teaching and learning about different topics in the Python programming language, especially for social science, data science, and visualization. This is ideal for learners who are new to Python --- you&#39;ll have a group of peers instead of being by yourself. If you&#39;re a little more advanced, you can try to teach something.

On this website, you can check out or improve our [learning resources](/learn). We also have a list of topics from [past meetings](/past). Please [send an email](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or join us on **Mondays from 5-6:30pm** at D-Lab (**350 Barrows Hall, UC Berkeley**). The [D-Lab](dlab.berkeley.edu) also offers many other free computing resources for academics, including workshops and 1-on-1 consulting.
