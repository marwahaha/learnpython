What&#39;s the big deal about Python? Stop by on Monday, February 8 at 5pm in the D-Lab (350 Barrows).

## Info
Today will be an introduction to Python and its possibilities. After, we will do a meet and greet to see how others use Python in an academic setting.

Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://marwahaha.github.io/learnpython/learn/#setup) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
