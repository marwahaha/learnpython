### BERC Cleanweb Hackathon 2.0

Local do-gooders are organizing a hackathon *this weekend* to engage some great
coders in coming up with solutions for opening access to utility data, water
conservation, and "devices and prices." And if you don't fit into any of those
categories, you're still eligible for the **grand prize**.

You can [register here](http://bit.ly/BERCHackRegister). And we can certainly
use more mentors, even if you can only come for the afternoon!

### Towards Open Data with Python

As you know, the "D" in D-Lab stands for "Social Science Data." But we still
have some pretty ad hoc methods for organizing this data. The R folks are [way
ahead of us](http://ropensci.org).

So, I'd like to have some discussion about best practices for pythonistas to
deal with open data - both in terms of libraries and in terms of archives
(looking towards something like the rOpenSci project linked above). Let's
do this!
