title: Pandas and econometrics at py4data
tags: py4data
author: Dav Clark

## Recap

 - We had eight people show up, mostly grad students (less than normal, perhaps
   due to a competing job fair).
 - This week people mostly worked independently on different projects. In
   particular people are starting to work with their own data.
 - Almost everyone is finding it useful to use
   [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) to read in their data sets
   and some people are starting to look at doing quantitative economics on their data.
 - Py4text is in the process of merging with py4data so that we have more skills
   and expertise in the room at once.

## Upcoming

Both organizers and py4data and py4text are entering a busy period of the
semester and we're realizing we have conflicts with other important events on
campus.  So:

 1. Py4text and py4data meetings will merge - we'll just call it py4data in the
    future
 2. Py4data is on hold while we try to figure out the best time to accomodate interested members of the py4science community.

So, if you're interested in hacking on some code with a like-minded Python
community, please join the py4data working group! (details will be forthcoming
here and on the mailing list.) But, **there is no meeting
this Friday, Oct 4 for py4data**.  The regular py4science meeting **will** meet
on Wednesday, and will keep meeting on alternating Wednesdays. 

As always, we'll coordinate here on python.berkeley.edu/py4science, and on the
py4science mailing list!
