### We're finishing up another training

The demand for Python training keeps going up! We actually had trouble fitting
this training into the D-Lab, and we've got a lot of motivated students (not all
university students, though!). Interested in welcoming the new Pythonistas? Come
to the Python Workers' Party and say hi! Help your colleagues get going on an
exciting new project, or show them what you've been working on.

If you bring snacks, you **get points**.

### Summer plans?

We'll also discuss plans for the summer, and point out that a sister group, [The
Hacker Within](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/), has also been going
strong this semester. Who knew? We should totally collaborate with these folks!
