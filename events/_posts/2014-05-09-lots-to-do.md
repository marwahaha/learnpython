### Recap of PyData?

PyData was great. It was a great reminder of how there's all these brilliant
people out there working really hard to provide us with awesome free tools. You
might check out the [schedule](http://pydata.org/sv2014/schedule/) and have a
discussion around some of the more interesting topics.

### Help a comrade out?

The D-Lab's very own Laura Nelson would like some help multiplying large
matrices (on the order of 400k x 20k). I don't know how to do this off the top
of my head, but if you could help her out on-list or at the Party, you may get
[points](http://python.berkeley.edu/points.html).

### Neat part-time job

I connected with the folks from the Art of Problem Solving at PyData.  They want
to pay you to give programming feedback to high school kids. [Check them
out](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Company/jobs.php) (scroll all the way to
the bottom for the "Graders" section).

### Carry on in Dav's absence

This brings me to my last point -- I will be busy doing something else *AGAIN*.
But I promise, next week, I'll show up and be super helpful and fun. Matthew
Brett and I have been kicking around the idea of having a meeting about
packaging, which for you academics out there could be central to developing your
own *CITED* code projects.

**Pinkies out!** [...or not](http://cheezburger.com/6171894784).
