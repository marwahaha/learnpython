title: R from Python with rpy2 - featuring rOpenSci!
author: Dav Clark
---
Our last formal meeting of the year!

### So you still want to use some R

Sure, we all love Python, but sometimes we need some fancy stats or viz in R
that will just *get your job done*. No worries,
[rpy2](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/) has your back!

As a demonstration, we'll show how you can use the awesome open and reproducible
science libraries from the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org) project from an
IPython notebook.

### Can it possibly be that easy?!?

Yes! Unless, as per usual, you are on windows. If you're interested, I'll talk
a bit about challenges that remain and what you might do to help.

### Fancy teaching Python in the D-Lab Jan 12-16?

It's a great experience, and we'll even pay you (a bit)! Please register your
interest at [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/issues/37) if you're
interested!
