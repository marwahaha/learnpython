title: Training the next generation of Pythonistas!
author: Dav Clark
---

This week, I'll get your input and kick the tires on my [Python Intensive
curriculum](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals) that [I'll be
teaching next week in the
D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/programming-fundamentals) (preceded by
a ["what is programming?"](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/python-intensive-0)
workshop).

I'd love to get your input, but *even more* I'd love it if **you can assist
teaching!** I especially need someone for **Tuesday: 10am-noon for programming
FUNdamentals** and **1-4pm for the Python Intensive.** But we can also use folks
Wed-Fri from 1-4pm.

### Updating the Site

Note that I updated [last weeks event](/events/2014/05/16/packaging-discussion.html) with links to the presentations (and the
links to ipynb files are automatically munged w/ nbviewer links via some
[moderately brittle javascript](/assets/nbview.js)).

**Anyone** can update the site via a pull request on GitHub! You'll get points, and
can compete with some of these [heavy hitters](/points).

That's right - the Python Workers' Party has it's own digital currency, and you
can even **mine your own points** using pull requests (and *ask* if you don't
know how!). But please use this power responsibly.

### Discussion

We have a *lot* of strong opinions. We had a lively discussion around how using
VMs might save instructional time, but reduce the usage of python in the long
run.

Teaching unit testing is hard. None of us know how to get people to write or
even run tests without some sort of authority. I've heard tales of such things,
though.

We're thinking it'd be good to have some motivation. Here are some example
papers and videos:

 - ADD YOUR OWN!
