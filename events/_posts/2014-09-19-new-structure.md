title: New Meeting Structure?

### Two kinds of meeting

I'm proposing that we shift to the following format (which is also reflected now
on the D-Lab website):

**1st Friday of each month:** "New and Exciting" topic. The talks we've had recently
about Blaze and Xray are good examples of that format.

**3rd Friday of each month:** "Beginners Mind". These weeks, folks are encouraged to
bring their own problems. Presentations should be accessible to folks who are
just getting started, and could focus on issues like project structure, etc.

Lightning talks are always welcome.

I'm also proposing that we start "for real" at 4:30. This week, I'm happy to
show up at 4, and anyone else is welcome to do so as well.
