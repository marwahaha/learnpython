title:  Hacking away at py4data
author: Dav Clark

## Continuing with didactic

Dav (that's me) led a brief tour of how easy it is to pull down financial data
from one of the major providers using pandas, and using methods right there on
the DataFrame to plot the results. But, there are pitfalls!

Find out more in the [py4data directory in the `master` branch](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/tree/master/py4data) of our repo (this site is managed in the
[`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/tree/gh-pages)).

## Settling into a reasonable pace

We continue to get newcomers, and some folks have still managed to come to every
meeting. While we're building expertise as a group, you are more than welcome to
drop in. Folks are making progress on everything from managing campus budgets,
to automatically classifying power plants. No challenge is turned away!

## Planning ahead for some open, battle tested science!

In only 4 weeks (Nov 22), we'll be starting on a group project to make some existing
scientific code open, easy-to-use, and well-tested. Tell your colleagues!

## Up next

There wasn't much feedback on what people wanted to see for the first 30 minutes
of the meeting, so I just chose something I thought would be useful. Please
contact me if you're interested in hearing about a particular topic. We can also
pull in expertise from other people!
