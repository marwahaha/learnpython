## About this post

This is the first post where we're using jQuery to automatically format links to
IPython notebooks (code [here](http://python.berkeley.edu/assets/nbview.js)).
For now, we automatically add a link to view in nbviewer following any link
ending in `.ipynb`. It would be pretty nifty if we could use javascript to look
for a notebook server (on `localhost:8888`?), and offer it a notebook somehow.
