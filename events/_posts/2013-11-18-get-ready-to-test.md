title:  Let's Get Ready to Test!
author: Dav Clark

We'll be having two events this coming week working towards creating
well-tested, ready-to-share scientific code.

## Py4science testing extravaganza

We couldn't do py4science last week, due to some absences and illnesses. So,
we'll pick up this week `Nov 20, 5-7pm` with:

- When to test (@cindeem will review this)
- [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (@katyhuff can help)
- [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html)
- Revisiting [unittest](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)

(Feel free to add your name above if you are planning to help with that section.)

## Py4data code porting and testing

Then, Friday, Nov 22 at noon, we'll start working on porting some
[pharmacological MR analysis code](https://www.github.com/iangreenhouse/MRS) to
battle-tested python. This project will serve as (we hope!) an exemplary model
for folks wanting to create reusable code for science. Should you come even if
you're not a neuroscientist? Definitely!  It's about the process here - not the
specific code.
