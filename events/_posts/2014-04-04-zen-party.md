### Python Koans

This Friday, I propose an exploration of ["Koans" for learning
python](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) (and potentially other
programming languages / frameworks). It turns out there's a whole internet
subculture dedicated to this "test-driven learning" idea that I've been talking
about with some of you!

As per usual, [the Hitchiker's Guide to
Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest) [already knew about
this](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/#python-koans).

Thanks to @ivanov for finding this, and yes, the Koan idea was started
by a Rubyist...

The python guide suggests the following links to find more koans [on
GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=koans&ref=cmdform) and [on
BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/all?name=koans).

### UPDATE: How'd it go?

The Python koans were surprisingly in line with the official python docs,
starting with [section
3](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/introduction.html). The Koans really
aren't usable for a beginner without some orientation to these or similar docs
(as is recommended by the above-mentioned [Hitchhiker's
Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/#python-koans).

The Koans are quite dry, and for a beginning non-programmer, they may wonder why
they spend all that time on the minutiae of string syntax. Jess did some work
making a strings notebook that has the user go through and test whether various
python strings are the same or different (using different syntax to get similar
or identical strings). For example, are the following equivalent?

``` python
str1 = "This has two lines?\n"
str2 = r"This has two lines?\n"
str3 = """This has two lines?
"""
```

If you're unsure, your python interpreter knows! And the above link to section 3
in the tutorial should get you sorted out...

Also, it turns out that Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as implemented by
RSpec and ["such"](http://nose2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/such_dsl.html) in
nose2 make Jess and Mike cringe. How about you?
