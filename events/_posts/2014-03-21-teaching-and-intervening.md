### Teaching

We just had another bootcamp! I've been thinking about planning for future
curricula in the D-Lab, and would love to chat with interested folks about what
we do next.

UPDATE: We talked about different approaches we might take:

William Stein paid us a visit, and mentioned the utility of introducing a
surprising gotcha after each topic.

You can (unsurprisingly) find some gotchas on [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/530530/python-2-x-gotchas-and-landmines)

### Mobile (and other) Interventions

I'll also be fresh from a meeting about how to do mobile interventions and
surveys, including technologies like Django. If folks wanted to touch base about
that, I'd love to! Look for updates with links after the meeting.

NOTE: We didn't actually get to this.

### Other stuff: William Stein / SAGE Math Cloud

[William Stein](http://modular.math.washington.edu/) presented [SAGE Math
Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/). It's pretty rad, you can use it for free.
He also still [skates vert](http://imgur.com/gallery/1fykucl).

### Fancy photo shoot

Lastly - Angela from the Berkeley Science Review showed up and took some
pictures of us. She also said she thought William's presentation was pretty
cool. Stay posted for further images.

### Spring Break

PLEASE NOTE - we will be taking a break over spring break. You should too! We'll
meet Friday, March 21, and then resume in April.
