### Go to a concert!

I will be going to [this
concert](http://www.burningriverbaroque.org/concerts/index.html) on Friday, and
I encourage you to do the same!

And since the D-Lab is on reduced hours now (M-Th 1-3pm), it seems right to cancel the Workers' Party this week...

### But despair not! 

Tomorrow (Wednesday), you can join The Hacker Within at 4pm. It's been pretty
chill since the summer hit, and they like you! And need your help / want to help
you! They have a [webpage on GitHub
pages](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/about.html), *just like us*.

I recommend hatching a plot to overthrow my despotic rule.

### And some open science?

If you fancy an evening out with some transparent and open science types, please
join us here:

> "Data Science Meets Social Science"<br>
> Thursday, June 5 | 6.00pm - 7.30pm<br>
> David Brower Center<br>
> 2150 Allston Way | Berkeley, CA

This event *also* has [a
website](http://cega.berkeley.edu/events/data-science-meets-social-science/)
(but not on GitHub).
