### Efficient multidimensional arrays?

This week, we'll continue with our exploration of high performance
numberical data structures with a presentation on [Xray](http://xray.readthedocs.org/).

And just in case you didn't check it out last week, I promise [these python xray
images](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+xray&tbm=isch) are worth a click!

### Other (free) stuff up the hill

Lawrence Berkeley Labs has published the [near-final agenda for
LabTech](http://go.lbl.gov/labtech) and there's still time to register whether
you want to attend just some or all of the day's activities on Sept 10th.

Highlights include morning mini-classes, including 3 one hour sessions on
getting the most out of Python in scientific computing, a 3 hour Arduino basics
class, and, new this year, Intro and Advanced LabVIEW.

The (free) Lunch and Keynote starts at noon, with an overview of what's new (and
old!) from IT this year.
