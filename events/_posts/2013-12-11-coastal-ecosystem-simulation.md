title: Coastal Ecosystem Simulation at Py4science
author: Dav Clark
---
Chris Kees and Aron Ahmadia will be presenting some of their work.

Chris is one of the lead developers of Proteus, a Python-based toolkit for the
solution of partial differential equations with coastal applications.  Aron is a
developer of PyClaw, a Python-based toolkit for the solution of wave propagation
problems.  from their email:

> We're mostly interested in meeting the newly-reinvigorated py4science group,
> and sharing a little bit about what we're working on over here at the US Army
> Engineer Research and Development Center in terms of how Python is helping us
> protect our coasts, estuaries, rivers, and levees.

These meetings are informal but fun. We meet from 5-7pm oon the 3rd floor of
Barrows Hall in the D-lab Convening Room (largish meeting room). And there
usually is pizza.

UPDATE: We saw presentations on [PyClaw](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack/)
and a way to install such gnarly code with
[HashDist](http://hashdist.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)/[HashStack](https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack)! **Even on Windows** (and equally gnarly supercomputing clusters)!
