## Next Time: Testing

Next meeting is in two weeks on 11/13/2013

**UPDATE:** 11/13 (today's) meeting postponed.

Unfortunately, some of our core presenters will be unavailable for this evening. As such, we are postponing tonight's py4science testing extravaganza until next week (11/20).

We'll be covering basic testing strategies and testing frameworks (unittest, py.test, nose, etc.).
