This was the second meeting of py4science!

## Attendance

There were 9 attendees, with an experience breakdown of:

* Experienced: 7
* Intermediate: 2
* New: 0

People came from the following departments and organizations:

* Neuroscience
* IPython
* Psychology
* D-Lab
* Bioengineering
* Vision Science

### Working Groups

Dav talked about the differences between working groups and the py4science meeting, emphasizing that py4science is more "show and tell" while py4text/py4data is more hands-on.

## Newbie Nugget

Cindee presented this week's Newbie Nugget. The topic is about `if __name__ ==
"__main__":`

Min pointed out that you can write files in IPython notebook using the
`%%file` cell magic!

Jess mentioned that `if __name__ == "__main__"` doesn't work well in emacs and IPython. Apparently python-mode ignores anything in the 'if' statement.

## Lightning Talks

### What's New in IPython

Presented by Min

Awesome stuff: `%matplotlib`, `raw_input`, `nbconvert`, widgets

### Python 3

Presented by Thomas

Thomas covered a range of topics, including: `print`, iterators, unicode, function annotation for
typechecking and command line argument parsing, yield from and return from generators.

Useful tip: `python -o` will remove assert statements!
