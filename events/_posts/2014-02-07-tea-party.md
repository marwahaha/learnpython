### Tea?

We had tea for our British friend. But, he didn't show up. We managed to get by,

### Lightning talks

 - Dav demo'd [rpy2](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.3/html/index.html)
   and
   [rmagic](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/extensions/rmagic.html) to
   send data you've cleaned up in Python to R.
 - Min just pushed %interact to master! [Check it out!](Check it out!)
 - Paul melted some brains with his ["vimception"
   plugin](https://github.com/ivanov/ipython-vimception) to enable
   multi-vim-mode in IPython notebook itself and every cell within.
