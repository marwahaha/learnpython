### Another week without Dav

You're ALWAYS welcome in the D-Lab from 4-6pm on a Friday to dig into Python,
and [last week's
event](http://python.berkeley.edu/events/2014/04/25/roundup.html) was certainly
evidence that *I* don't need to be there!

But many of us will be attending PyData this weekend (and there's certainly
still time to [sign up](http://pydata.org/sv2014/)).
