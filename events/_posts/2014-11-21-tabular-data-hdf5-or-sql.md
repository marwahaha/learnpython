title: Tabular Data Smackdown - HDF5 or SQL?
author: Dav Clark
---
### Tabular data?

Tabular data shows up all the time. You've probably seen it in spreadsheets, but
if you need more speed, data security, or advanced features, you might be
happier using something like HDF5 or SQL.

### So, what to use?

It turns out that different tools are good for different jobs. @katyhuff, the
organizer of [the Berkeley chapter of the Hacker
Within](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/) will take us through some
examples of when you might use a relational database (using
[sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)) vs. an efficient
tabular storage format (using [pytables](http://www.pytables.org/)).

If there's time, she'll take us through some examples of using pytables.
Tutorial material is available [here](https://github.com/katyhuff/db-wkshp).

Bring your questions and data challenges, and let's see if we can solve *your*
problems.
