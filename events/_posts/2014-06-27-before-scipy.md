### Some of us are going to SciPy

So, next meeting might be a good time to touch base on what we'll do at SciPy!
In particular, if folks want to do a run-through of what they'll be presenting,
this will be a great time. If you don't know what SciPy is, there's [a
website](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/).

We'll also have at least one new visitor, so plenty to do! Look forward to
seeing you there!

For those of you that want it, here's a link to [the current build of
BCE](https://berkeley.box.com/s/ybysi4qcv75vw84tjl5h).
