### Thanks for your help thinking about data!

Last week we had a great brainstorming session about open data. The results of
that session made their way into a ["concerns"
file](https://github.com/infoEnergy/data/blob/master/CONCERNS.md). Also, check
out the [winners of the hackathon](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co/winners-2014/) --
you helped them!

### Carry on in Dav's absence

Tomorrow, I will be attending a [workshop on Buddhism and
Science](http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/events/). So, I won't make the
Worker's party. However, the Python Workers' Party is not about *me*, so you are
welcome to come hang out in the D-Lab from 4-6 anyway.

In particular, there is a fancy Blum center tour around campus that will be
hitting the convening room at 5:25 and 5:45. But, [the invite
list](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dil-innovation-crawl-tickets-11257757255?aff=es2)
is now closed.

But, you're special, because you already have a reason to be in that space!
However, we should relocate the hacking out to the public space (the
collaboratory) instead of the classroom ("convening room") that we normally use.

### Jobs

I met a fella looking to hire a python programmer for reciprocity labs.
Reciprocity labs sounds AWESOME. It's like literate computing (think IPython
notebooks) for corporate governance and risk management (i.e., good
citizenship). Worried that companies like Google are spying (or just helping the
NSA spy) on the nation? These are the guys that are engineering solutions that
can help us be sure that DOESN'T happen.

Should we have a job board? Or point to one? Let me know or [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley)!
