We'll have our first substantive meeting this week on 10/02/2013!

As per usual, we'll meet from 5-7pm, but *unlike previously* we'll meet in the
large breakout room, 371 Barrows. The door is around the corner from the main
D-Lab entrance.

Meetings are still every other week, but may change to every week if there's
enough content.

## Schedule

 - Cindee will do the newbie nugget
 - Lightning talks on advanced topics (~20 minutes each)
 - Python 3 (Thomas)
 - New stuff in IPython (Min)

**Next meeting: editor extravaganza!**
