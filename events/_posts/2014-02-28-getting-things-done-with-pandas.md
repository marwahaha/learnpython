title: Getting Things Done with Pandas!

### Pandas? What's that?

[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) has become a hub of activity for the
development of useful, (relatively) easy tools for doing all kinds of "data
science." This functionality is built around a central DataFrame structure
(familiar to those of you coming from R), and includes support for oft-neglected
stages of science like data cleaning and exploratory plotting.

### The plan

We didn't quite get through all the nice ways to use matplotlib last week, so
we'll be ready to have a quick look at:

 - [Seaborn](http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/), which makes it
   easier to plot using pandas *and* make things look nice.
 - [Vectorized string
   methods](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/basics.html#vectorized-string-methods)
   that make your data-cleaning life easier.
 - Dav used stock data using [the pandas io
   module](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/remote_data.html) for one
   example.

But we always welcome short talks from everyone! Particularly if you are haven't
spoken before!

If there's interest, after the lightning talks, I (Dav) will lead a group on
fixing a bug in the string methods linked above, and we'll try submitting a pull
request against pandas on github.
