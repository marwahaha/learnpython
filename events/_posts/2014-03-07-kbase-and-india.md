title: Updates from KBase and open Indian computing training
author: Dav Clark

We had some great presentations today! Stephen Chan from LBNL's KBase team, and
Kannan Moudgalya.

### KBase

KBase is a project to adapt the IPython notebook to fascilitate collaboration
between computational and experimental (bench) biologists. But they want to
expand.  There is a developer preview at [demo.kbase.us](http://demo.kbase.us),
you can sign up!

### Spoken Tutorial

Spoken Tutorial is a systematic approach to providing materials like Rails
Casts. (Is there something like this in Python? Submit a pull-request!)

Check out [these statistics](http://spoken-tutorial.org/statistics)!

This program offers vetted, open, downloadable screencasts in hybrid
English/native language instruction. Materials span open office software to
Scilab and Python.

### FOSSEE

The Indian government has also heavily invested in building out free software
infrastructure for reasearch and education.

Approximate rationale: “We take a loan from the World Bank, and burn that money
on Matlab®”

So, there is now a pipeline to create Scilab and Python materials for over 500
textbooks in science and engineering. All of these materials are [available
online](http://fossee.in/).

It's hard to get students to use FOSS! But one success is when students realize
that Turbo C (you read that correctly) is a barrier to pass a class -- then
they're willing to switch to gcc on linux.

### Akash Tablet

They apparently also make [these tablets](http://aakashlabs.org/), which
aim to be the cheapest linux computers in the world.
