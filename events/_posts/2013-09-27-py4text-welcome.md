Some folks have already found out about our py4text Working group, meeting
Fridays at the D-Lab from 2-4pm. And there's apparently some confusion. So, just
to be clear:

## All members of the Py4Science community are welcome!

We are currently figuring out the schedule for the working group this semester.  Check back soon for an update.
